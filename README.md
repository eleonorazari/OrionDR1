# OrionDR1
Notebooks and queries used for the Orion paper.

Unfortunately the data files are too big to be uploaded, however the queries (see Queries.txt) 
can be used to retrieve them from the Archive.

The notebook titled KDEs is the collection of the scripts used to produce Fig. 4, 6, 8, 9, and 15.
Note that for Fig. 15, you need to install this package: http://dustmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.
